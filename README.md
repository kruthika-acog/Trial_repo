Hi! Kruthika here practising some markdown language.

Steps I did to add files to this github repo from local repo:

``` mermaid
graph LR;
A[git pull]-->B[git add]
B-->C[git commit -a -m message]
C-->D[git push]
```

Today I have to study what is typing in Python. ALso have to go through this link: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/
That link has tutorial for shell scripting too. Yaad rakhna

Let's make a table for no reason ;)

| Rank | My fav web series |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1| The Untamed          |
|     2| Asur II              |
|     3| Lucifer              |

How about wrap it up?

<details>
  <summary> My fav web series</summary>
  | Rank | My fav web series |
  |-----:|---------------|
  |     1| The Untamed          |
  |     2| Asur II              |
  |     3| Lucifer              |
</details>
Aiyyo why is the table not appearing in format???
