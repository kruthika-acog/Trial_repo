Hi! Kruthika here practising some markdown language :)

Steps I did to add files to this github repo from local repo:

``` mermaid
graph LR;
A[git pull]-->B[git add]
B-->C[git commit -a -m message]
C-->D[git push]
```

Today I have to study what is typing in Python. ALso have to go through this link: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/

That link has tutorial for shell scripting too. __Yaad rakhna__

Let's make a table for no reason __;)__

| Rank | My fav web series |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1| The Untamed          |
|     2| Asur II              |
|     3| Lucifer              |

How about wrap it up?

<details>
<summary> My fav web series</summary>
| Rank | My fav web series |
|-----:|---------------|
|     1| The Untamed          |
|     2| Asur II              |
|     3| Lucifer              |
</details>
Aiyyo why is the table not appearing in format???

See some basic formatting syntax here (text format and text colours): https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

Now I feel github and git are manageable. Docker is a bit confusing, though the kokekloud tutorials are helping. Will soon get used to it. __:D__
Table error not solved yet. :(
